# basicpythonpipeline

This pipeline takes DNA sequences in FASTA format as input and does the following tasks: calculate sequence lengths, count the occurrence of each nucleotide (A, C, G, T), and identify potential coding regions (open reading frames).



Notes:


This is a very basic illustration of a pipeline in Python. Functional pipelines often need additional tasks, so this one can be expanded as needed.


The pipeline assumes the input file contains DNA sequences in FASTA format. You can make a file named "input_sequences.fasta" and fill it with dna sequences.


The BioPython library is used for handling sequence data and doing basic bioinformatics tasks in general.


The pipeline has three functions: calculate_sequence_lengths, count_nucleotides, and find_orfs.


The calculate_sequence_lengths function calculates and prints the length of each DNA sequence.


The count_nucleotides function counts the occurrence of each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) in each DNA sequence.


The find_orfs function finds potential coding regions (ORFs) in each DNA sequence with a minimum specified length.
